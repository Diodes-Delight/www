Piunora is a compact, easy-to-use development board for electronics prototyping with Linux. It has a familiar form factor, legible pin labels, and a design that’s well suited to space-constrained applications.

As a carrier board for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 and 5 (CM4, CM5), Piunora is essentially a tiny version of the Raspberry Pi 4/5 Single Board Computer (SBC) with added flexibility to accommodate custom form factors. CM4-based devices like Piunora are fully compatible with software that was written for the Raspberry Pi 4/5, as long as that software accounts for the hardware peripherals in use. There are also versions of the CM4 / CM5 that include eMMC memory, which is more reliable than a traditional SD card.

It may be small, but Piunora is packed with powerful peripherals!

## Features & Specifications

- Arduino UNO R3 / Adafruit Metro compatible form factor (3.3 V logic, may not be compatible with all Shields)
- PCI-e through M.2 B-Key connector on the rear of the board with dedicated 3.3 V / 3 A supply
- Analog to Digital Converter (MCP3008)
- On-the-fly switching between USB host (USB Type-A) and device mode (USB Type-C)
- Qwiic/Stemma QT connector to easily interface with I²C devices
- A full-sized camera connector that supports all Pi-compatible cameras
- A full-sized HDMI 2.0 port
- A WS2812 Smart RGB LED for user status
- Optional Wi-Fi or eMMC options depending on your choice of Compute Module
- Slim design with Piunora Pro measuring 11-13 mm
- Two user-controllable buttons (including software that turns one of them into a safe-shutdown button)
- Piunora is open hardware, and we will publish both our design files and our software by the time it ships

On CM5 the camera connector can also be used with displays if you adapt the connector (it will not work as is with official Raspberry Pi displays as the pin-out would not match)

Because Piunora was designed with the CM4 in mind some newer features of the CM5 like USB3 are not available but as long as the physical signal is routed you can take advantage of the upgraded features like the faster PCI-e or that DSI and CSI are available on the same port.

Piunora Lite is deprecated. This model was identical to Piunora Pro but the bottom side M.2 and FPC Camera connector were not populated slimming it down to 8-12 mm.
If you need a slimmed down or customized version of Piunora feel free to get in touch. Customized designs and production runs are possible.
